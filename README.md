# Traffic-Sign-Detection
This is a Machine Learning Project which helps to detect and classify the type of traffic sign in real time which is captured by an vehicle's onboard camera.
The detailed research paper and all the results are included in FINAL.zip file.
Please note that this is a project which I have built along with my college team by taking help from existing research on this topic.
